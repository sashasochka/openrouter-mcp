# Claude Code MCP CLI Management Guide

## Overview

The OpenRouter MCP Server now includes a powerful CLI management system for Claude Code, allowing you to easily add, remove, and configure MCP servers using simple commands.

## Installation

The MCP CLI management system is automatically included with the OpenRouter MCP Server installation.

## Usage

### Using the Standalone CLI

You can use the `claude_mcp.py` script directly:

```bash
python claude_mcp.py [COMMAND] [OPTIONS]
```

The purpose of this project is to provide an external tool that will allow running multiple heavy models in parralel (like 8 gpt5-pro instances + gemini 2.5 pro + grok 4) and then helps to ensemble reductive reasoning so help models re-run with each other's cross-arguments and help deduce the best answer based on that. Each new attempt should run less agents. If there is a high level of agreement - run much less models on the second run. More disagreement - more parralel runs next time. Up to 4 possible total runs. The last step is using the most powerful model to assemble the most advanced answer possible combining the power of the most powerful competetive models from OpenAI, Google, Anthropic and xAI (and more). This execution strategy powers the adaptive multi-run ensemble approach used by the collective tools: an initial wide parallel pass across many competitive models, up to three additional passes with fewer models when agreement is high (or more models if disagreement persists), and a final synthesis pass by the strongest model to produce the consolidated answer.


### Available Commands

#### 1. Add an MCP Server

Add a new MCP server using presets or custom configuration:

```bash
# Add OpenRouter server with API key
python claude_mcp.py add openrouter --api-key sk-or-your-key-here

# Add GitHub server with token
python claude_mcp.py add github --env GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_xxx

# Add filesystem server with directories
python claude_mcp.py add filesystem --args /path/to/dir1 --args /path/to/dir2

# Add custom server
python claude_mcp.py add myserver --command python --args server.py --cwd /project
```

Options:
- `--api-key`: API key for servers that require authentication
- `--force`: Force overwrite if server already exists
- `--command`: Command to run the server (for custom servers)
- `--args`: Arguments for the server command (can be used multiple times)
- `--cwd`: Working directory for the server
- `--env`: Environment variables in KEY=VALUE format (can be used multiple times)

#### 2. List MCP Servers

List all installed MCP servers:

```bash
# Simple list
python claude_mcp.py list

# Verbose list with details
python claude_mcp.py list --verbose
```

#### 3. Get Server Status

Get detailed status of a specific MCP server:

```bash
python claude_mcp.py status openrouter
```

#### 4. Configure a Server

Update configuration for an existing MCP server:

```bash
# Update API key
python claude_mcp.py config openrouter --env OPENROUTER_API_KEY=new-key

# Update working directory
python claude_mcp.py config myserver --cwd /new/path

# Update arguments
python claude_mcp.py config filesystem --args /new/dir1 --args /new/dir2
```

#### 5. Remove a Server

Remove an MCP server from Claude Code:

```bash
python claude_mcp.py remove openrouter
```

## Available Presets

The following MCP servers are available as presets for easy installation:

### OpenRouter
Provides access to multiple AI models through OpenRouter's API.

```bash
python claude_mcp.py add openrouter --api-key YOUR_OPENROUTER_API_KEY
```

Required: OpenRouter API key from https://openrouter.ai

### Filesystem
Provides file system access to specified directories.

```bash
python claude_mcp.py add filesystem --args ~/Documents --args ~/Desktop
```

### GitHub
Provides GitHub repository access and management.

```bash
python claude_mcp.py add github --env GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN=ghp_xxx
```

Required: GitHub Personal Access Token

### Memory
Provides in-memory storage capabilities.

```bash
python claude_mcp.py add memory
```

## Integration with Claude Code

After adding MCP servers, restart Claude Code CLI to use the new tools. The configuration is automatically saved to:

- **Windows**: `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\claude_code_config.json`
- **macOS/Linux**: `~/.claude/claude_code_config.json`

## Configuration File Structure

The MCP servers are stored in the Claude Code configuration file:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "openrouter": {
      "command": "python",
      "args": ["-m", "src.openrouter_mcp.server"],
      "cwd": "/path/to/openrouter-mcp",
      "env": {
        "OPENROUTER_API_KEY": "sk-or-xxx",
        "HOST": "localhost",
        "PORT": "8000"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Python API

You can also use the MCP Manager programmatically:

```python
from src.openrouter_mcp.cli import MCPManager, MCPServerConfig

# Create manager
manager = MCPManager()

# Add a server
config = MCPServerConfig(
    name="myserver",
    command="python",
    args=["server.py"],
    env={"API_KEY": "secret"}
)
manager.add_server(config)

# List servers
servers = manager.list_servers()
print(f"Installed servers: {servers}")

# Get server status
status = manager.get_server_status("myserver")
print(f"Server status: {status}")

# Remove server
manager.remove_server("myserver")
```

## Troubleshooting

### Server Not Found
If you get a "server not found" error, check that:
1. The server name is correct
2. The server has been added (use `list` command)

### Permission Errors
If you encounter permission errors:
1. Ensure you have write access to the Claude config directory
2. Try running with appropriate permissions

### API Key Issues
For servers requiring API keys:
1. Ensure the API key is valid
2. Check that environment variables are set correctly
3. Use the `config` command to update keys

## Advanced Features

### Backup and Restore

The MCP Manager automatically creates backups when modifying configuration:

```python
from src.openrouter_mcp.cli import MCPManager

manager = MCPManager()

# Create manual backup
backup_path = manager.backup_config()
print(f"Backup created: {backup_path}")

# Restore from backup
manager.restore_config(backup_path)
```

### Cross-Platform Support

The MCP CLI automatically handles platform-specific paths and configurations:
- Windows paths are properly escaped
- Home directory expansion works on all platforms
- Environment variables are platform-appropriate

## Examples

### Complete Setup Example

```bash
# 1. Add OpenRouter server
python claude_mcp.py add openrouter --api-key sk-or-xxx

# 2. Add filesystem access to Desktop
python claude_mcp.py add filesystem --args ~/Desktop

# 3. List all servers
python claude_mcp.py list --verbose

# 4. Restart Claude Code CLI
# The MCP tools are now available!
```

### Using in Claude Code

After setup, you can use the MCP tools in Claude Code:

```
User: List available AI models
Claude: I'll list the available models using the OpenRouter MCP tool...

User: Read files from my Desktop
Claude: I'll access your Desktop using the filesystem MCP tool...
```

### Using Collective Intelligence Tools

The OpenRouter MCP Server includes 5 advanced collective intelligence tools for enhanced AI collaboration:

```bash
# Example: Multi-model consensus for complex decisions
User: "Use collective intelligence to analyze the pros and cons of remote work with 3 different models"
Claude: I'll use the collective_chat_completion tool to get consensus from multiple AI models...

# Example: Ensemble reasoning for complex problems
User: "Apply ensemble reasoning to design a sustainable energy solution for a small city"
Claude: I'll use ensemble_reasoning to decompose this complex problem and assign different aspects to specialized models...

# Example: Adaptive model selection for optimal performance
User: "Automatically select the best model for writing a Python function to process large datasets"
Claude: I'll use adaptive_model_selection to find the most suitable model for this coding task...

# Example: Cross-model validation for accuracy
User: "Validate this scientific statement across multiple models: 'Quantum computers will replace classical computers within 10 years'"
Claude: I'll use cross_model_validation to verify this claim across multiple AI models...

# Example: Collaborative problem solving
User: "Solve this business challenge collaboratively: How to reduce customer churn by 30% in 6 months"
Claude: I'll use collaborative_problem_solving to get multiple models working together on this challenge...
```

### Performance Benefits

The collective intelligence tools provide significant advantages:

- **Higher Accuracy**: Multi-model consensus reduces individual model biases
- **Better Quality**: Cross-validation ensures response reliability  
- **Optimal Performance**: Adaptive selection chooses the best model for each task
- **Complex Problem Solving**: Ensemble reasoning handles multi-faceted challenges
